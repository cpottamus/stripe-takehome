# Welcome to my hot dog store!

I chose to build off of DPS's slick React Search, and lightweight "cart". The pins are hilarious. I futzed with building a Flask+Jinja/React hybrid for a while, but struggled to get Jinja to play nice with additional React components, so I just reimplemented everything in React+Express. His code is only used for design and the initial Search, the rest is my own or from the docs.

Design is minimal. Hot Dogs are plentiful. Enjoy!
